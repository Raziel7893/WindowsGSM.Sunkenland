# First Start Steps:
- The server can not create it's own world, and therefore there are a few steps to start using that.
  - open Browse => server files and open the PDF in there and follow the **Before First Time Running the Dedicated Server** section
    - The world guid is then set via Edit Config => Server Start Map 
  - or would recommend that howto: https://youtu.be/5HWE1wtBt7A 
    - Steps that change the arguments in the bat file are done in Edit Config => Server Start Param
    - The world guid is set via Edit Config => Server Start Map  
- It seems, that currently Steam is needed to be installed on the same Machine, and also be run and logged in, as it makes a license check on startUp.
- If you want to connect to your own server on the same PC:
  -   go to your steam Library, rightclick on sunkenland, browse local files and execute the Sunkenland.exe manually. you apparently can not run Sunkenland via steam while the dedicated server is running on the same machine
